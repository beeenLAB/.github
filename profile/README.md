## Hey, this is beeen LAB 👋

We are **beeen LAB**, a place where experiments meet innovation.  
Our mission is to build and explore **cutting-edge backend technologies** in a safe, experimental environment.  

Currently, we operate from a single IDC home server.   
Testing and learning everything from **backend frameworks** to **infrastructure setups**.   
Our goal? **Rapid experimentation, hands-on learning, and continuous growth** for backend developers. ⚡

### 🧪 Our playground

At beeen LAB, we focus on building systems and tools 
that **push the boundaries of backend development**.   <br>
Some of what we explore:

- **Server environments**:<br>Deploy and configure servers to learn system internals.  
- **Infrastructure automation**:<br>Experiment with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and more.  
- **Deployment systems**:<br>Leverage **IDC Harbor** as a private container registry to manage and securely deploy services.  
- **Monitoring systems**:<br>Build dashboards with **Grafana** to visualize metrics, track anomalies, and detect performance issues in real-time.  
- **Failure response**:<br>Operate a beeen LAB server environment to practice incident response<br>— from diagnosing downtime and log analysis, to restoring services and improving reliability strategies.  

We embrace curiosity and experimentation, and every project is a step toward<br>**smarter, faster, and more robust backend systems**. 🚀
