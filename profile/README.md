## Hey, this is beeen LAB ðŸ‘‹

We are **beeen LAB**, a place where experiments meet innovation.  
Our mission is to build and explore **cutting-edge backend technologies** in a safe, experimental environment.  

Currently, we operate from a single home server, testing and learning everything from **backend frameworks** to **infrastructure setups**. Our goal? **Rapid experimentation, hands-on learning, and continuous growth** for backend developers. âš¡

### ðŸ§ª Our playground

At beeen LAB, we focus on building systems and tools that **push the boundaries of backend development**. Some of what we explore:

- **Server environments**: Deploy and configure servers to learn system internals.
- **Infrastructure automation**: Experiment with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and more.

We embrace curiosity and experimentation, and every project is a step toward **smarter, faster, and more robust backend systems**. ðŸš€
